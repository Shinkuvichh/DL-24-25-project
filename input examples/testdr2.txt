The raw materials for planet formation are forged deep within stars through a process called stellar nucleosynthesis. For the first few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, the universe consisted almost entirely of hydrogen and helium. Heavier elements, which astronomers call "metals," were created later in the cores of stars. Stars are giant fusion reactors, where immense pressure and temperature force lighter atomic nuclei to merge into heavier ones. In stars like our Sun, hydrogen is fused into helium through the proton-proton chain reaction. In more massive stars, the CNO cycle achieves the same result more efficiently. As these stars age, they begin fusing helium into carbon, and subsequently into oxygen, neon, and other heavier elements. This process continues, creating elements up to iron in the most massive stars. Iron is the final element produced through fusion, as its creation consumes energy rather than releasing it. When a massive star exhausts its fuel, its core collapses, triggering a supernova explosion. This cataclysmic event releases an enormous amount of energy, creating elements heavier than iron through processes like neutron capture. The supernova then blasts these newly synthesized elements across interstellar space. This enriched material mixes with existing molecular clouds of gas and dust. Subsequent generations of stars and their planetary systems form from these enriched clouds. Therefore, planets like Earth are composed of stardust, the recycled material from long-dead stars. The specific composition of a protoplanetary disk depends on the history of star formation in its galactic neighborhood. The presence of elements like silicon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium is essential for the formation of rocky planets. Carbon and nitrogen are fundamental for the building blocks of life as we know it. The abundance of these elements dictates the potential chemistry of any forming worlds. The icy bodies in the outer Solar System, like comets and Kuiper Belt Objects, preserve a pristine record of the volatile materials present in the early solar nebula. Studying their composition gives us clues about the ingredients available for planet formation. The isotopic ratios of different elements in meteorites can even trace their origins back to specific types of stars. This field of study is known as cosmochemistry. It connects the vast processes of stellar evolution with the tangible materials that make up our world. The formation of a habitable planet is thus a story of cosmic recycling on a grand scale. Without the life and death of multiple generations of stars, the chemical complexity needed for life would not exist. Our existence is directly linked to the violent and creative processes of the cosmos. Every atom in our bodies, heavier than hydrogen, was once part of a star. This profound connection highlights our place within the larger story of the universe's evolution. The ongoing cycle of star birth and death continues to enrich the galaxy, setting the stage for future planetary systems.
